cshatag is a tool to detect silent data corruption. It is meant to run periodically
and stores the SHA256 of each file as an extended attribute. The project started
as a minimal and fast reimplementation of [shatag](https://github.com/maugier/shatag),
written in Python by Maxime Augier.

See the [Man Page](#man-page) further down this page for details.

NAME
       cshatag - compiled shatag

SYNOPSIS
       cshatag [OPTIONS] FILE [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       cshatag is a minimal and fast re-implementation of shatag
       ( https://github.com/maugier/shatag , written in Python by Maxime Augier
       )
       in a compiled language (since v2.0: Go, earlier versions: C).

       cshatag  is a tool to detect silent data corruption. It writes the mtime
       and the sha256 checksum of a file into the file's  extended  attributes.
       The  filesystem  needs to be mounted with user_xattr enabled for this to
       work.  When run again, it compares stored  mtime  and  checksum.  If  it
       finds that the mtime is unchanged but the checksum has changed, it warns
       on stderr.  In any case, the status of the file is printed to stdout and
       the stored checksum is updated.

       File statuses that appear on stdout are:
            <new>         file is missing both attributes
            <outdated>    both mtime and checksum have changed
            <ok>          both checksum and mtime stayed the same
            <timechange>  only mtime has changed, checksum stayed the same
            <corrupt>     mtime stayed the same but checksum changed

       cshatag  aims  to be format-compatible with shatag and uses the same ex‐
       tended attributes (see the COMPATIBILITY section).

       cshatag was written in C in 2012 and has been rewritten in Go in 2019.

OPTIONS
       -dry-run    don't make any changes
       -j          number of threads. Values <= 0 means auto
                   (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charlievieth/fastwalk#De‐
       faultNumWorkers).
       -recursive  recursively process the contents of directories
       -remove     remove cshatag's xattrs from FILE
       -q          quiet mode - don't report <ok> files
       -qq         quiet2 mode - only report <corrupt> files and errors
       -fix        fix the stored sha256 on corrupt files

EXAMPLES
       Check all regular files in the file tree below the current  working  di‐
       rectory:
       # cshatag -qq -recursive .
       Errors  like corrupt files will be printed to stderr.  Run without "-qq"
       to see progress output.

       To remove the extended attributes from all files:
       # cshatag -recursive -remove .

RETURN VALUE
       0 Success
       1 Wrong number of arguments
       2 One or more files could not be opened
       3 One or more files is not a regular file
       4 Extended attributes could not be written to one or more files
       5 At least one file was found to be corrupt
       6 More than one type of error occurred

COMPATIBILITY
       cshatag writes the user.shatag.ts field  with  full  integer  nanosecond
       precision,  while python uses a double for the whole mtime and loses the
       last few digits.
